# Excel 101 #

## Introduction ##

Tools are essential to data journalism, the software or programming languages we use determine the different ways we can manipulate our data and how we can verify it. When starting out on the data journalism path, Excel is the first stop. 

Excel is easy to learn and comeby - there won't be any nasty installation issues like other tools. 

Excel is structured into tables and rows with a maximum row count of 1,048,576 - but be warned it's not software that scales well. I don't advise using it for a data set that is larger than 10,000 rows.

However it is very easy to delete or dirty your data in Excel and so you must be very careful when using data and keep a copy of the original so you can retrace your steps is something goes wrong.
